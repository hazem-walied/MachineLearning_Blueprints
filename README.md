# MachineLearning_Blueprints

Welcome to the **ML From Scratch** repository! This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models built from the ground up, without using high-level machine learning libraries. It's designed for those who want to understand the inner workings of these algorithms and how they are implemented step by step.

## About

The goal of this repository is to provide clear and concise implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms. Each model is implemented in Python, and the code is designed to be easy to read and educational. This is a great resource for anyone looking to:

- Learn how machine learning models work under the hood.
- Reinforce theoretical knowledge with practical coding.
- Experiment with basic models without relying on external libraries.

These projects were part of my university projects and assignments, and I found them important enough to create this repository to share and revisit them.

## Implemented Models

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Gradient Descent
   - Closed-form Solution
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
4. **Decision Tree**
5. **Autoencoder as Denoiser**
6. More models coming soon!

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Basic Python libraries: 
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas` (optional, for dataset handling)
  - `matplotlib` (optional, for visualization)

You can install the required libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-from-scratch.git
cd ml-from-scratch
```

2. Navigate to the folder of the model you want to explore and run the script:

```bash
python linear_regression.py
```

Each script is standalone and comes with example data or uses generated data for demonstration.

## Usage

- Explore individual files to understand the implementation of each algorithm.
- Modify the scripts to use your own datasets.
- Use the functions provided in the scripts to experiment with different parameters and datasets.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new models, improve existing implementations, or fix bugs, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Please ensure your code is well-documented and follows the repository's coding style.
